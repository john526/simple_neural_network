TRAINING PROCESS

- Take the inputs from the training example, and put them through our formula to get the neuron's output

- Calculate the error. Which is the difference between the output we got and the actual output

- Depending on the severeness of the error, adjust the weights accordingly

- Repeat this 20.000 times



ERRORS WEIGHTED DERIVATIVE


Adjust weights by = error.input.phi'(output)

Error = output - actual output

input = either 1 or 0
